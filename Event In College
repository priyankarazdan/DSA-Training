Problem Statement:
A event is organised in your College. The event is organised for a limited time(T). The number of student entering and leaving the event at every hour is represented as elements of the array. The task is to find the maximum number of students present in the event at any given instance within T hours.



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  
    int T;
    cin >> T;

    int entering_students[T];
    int leaving_students[T];

    for (int i = 0; i < T; ++i) {
        cin >> entering_students[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < T; ++i) {
        cin >> leaving_students[i];
    }

    int max_students = 0;
    int current_students = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < T; ++i) {
        current_students += entering_students[i];
        current_students -= leaving_students[i];

        if (current_students > max_students) {
            max_students = current_students;
        }
    }

    cout << max_students << endl;

    return 0;
}
