Problem statement:
You are given a Singly Linked List of integers and an integer 'K'. Your task is to remove all such nodes from the linked list whose value is equal to 'K'.
A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which we can traverse only in one direction i.e., from Head to Tail. It consists of several nodes where each node contains some data and a reference to the next node.


Node *removeNodes(Node *head, int k) {
    if(head == NULL)
        return NULL;

    Node *temp = removeNodes(head->next,k);
    head->next = temp;

    if((head->data)==k)
    {
        return head->next;
    }
    else
        return head;
    
}
