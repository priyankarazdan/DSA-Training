Problem statement
You have been given an array/list 'ARR' consisting of 'N' integers. Your task is to find the majority element in the array. If there is no majority element present, print -1.
Note:
A majority element is an element that occurs more than floor('N' / 2) times in the array.



#include <bits/stdc++.h>

int findMajorityElement(int arr[], int n) {
	map<int, int> ob;
	for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
		ob[arr[i]]++;
    if(ob[arr[i]]>n/2)
    return arr[i];
	}
	return -1;
}
