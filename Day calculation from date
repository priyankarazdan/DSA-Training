Problem Statement:
Mr. Rijul want to create an application to calculate the day of the week on which someone was born or some other special event occurred. He want to use Zellerâ€™s Rule for calculating the day of the week for a given date.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int day,month,year;
    cin>>day;
    cin>>month;
    cin>>year;
   
   
    if (month==1 || month==2){
       month+=10;
       year-=1;
    }
    else
       month-=2;
   
    int k=day;
   
    int D=year%100;
    int C=year/100;
   
    int F=k+ ((13*month-1)/5) +D+ (D/4) +(C/4)-2*C;
    int rem=abs(F%7);
    switch(rem){
        case 0:
            cout<<"Sunday";
            break;
        case 1:
            cout<<"Monday";
            break;
        case 2:
            cout<<"Tuesday";
            break;
        case 3:
            cout<<"Wednesday";
            break;
        case 4:
            cout<<"Thursday";
            break;
        case 5:
            cout<<"Friday";
            break;
        case 6:
            cout<<"Saturday";
            break;
    }
    return 0;
}
