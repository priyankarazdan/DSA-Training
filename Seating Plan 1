Problem:
Mr. X and Mr. Y are quite fond of travelling. They mostly travel by railways. They were travelling in a train one day and they got interested in the seating arrangement of their compartment. The compartment looked something like
So they got interested to know the seat number facing them and the seat type facing them. The seats are denoted as follows :
Window Seat : WS
Middle Seat : MS
Aisle Seat : AS
You will be given a seat number, find out the seat number facing you and the seat type, i.e. WS, MS or AS.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int T, N;
    cin >> T;
    while (T--) {
        cin >> N;
        int index = (N - 1) % 12;
        int facingSeat = N + 11 - 2 * index;

        string seatType;
        switch (index) {
            case 0: case 5: case 6: case 11:
                seatType = "WS";
                break;
            case 1: case 4: case 7: case 10:
                seatType = "MS";
                break;
            case 2: case 3: case 8: case 9:
                seatType = "AS";
                break;
        }

        cout << seatType << " " << facingSeat << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
