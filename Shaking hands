Objective:
Six business people meet for lunch and shake hands with each other.
How many handshakes are there?
Example If two people shake hands there is one handshake. If three people shake hands there are 3 handshakes. If four people shake hands there are 3 more handshakes so 3 + 3 = 6 in total. If five people shake hands there are another 4 handshakes so 6 + 4 = 10. For 6 people there are another 5 handshakes so 10 + 5 = 15.

    if (N < 2 || N > 100) {
        return 1; 
    }
   
    int handshakes = (N * (N - 1)) / 2;
    cout << handshakes << endl;
    return 0;
