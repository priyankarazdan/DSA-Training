You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.


int maxProfit(int* prices, int pricesSize){
    int ma = 0, mi = prices[0];
    for (int i = 0; i < pricesSize; i++){
        if (prices[i] - mi > ma){
            ma = prices[i] - mi;
        }
        if (prices[i] < mi){
            mi = prices[i];
        }
    }
    return ma;
}
