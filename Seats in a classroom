Problem Statement:
Here, We need to write a code to find all the possible ways in which n people can occupy r number of seats in a classroom/theater.
N students are looking to find r seats in a classroom. Some of the seats are already occupied and only a few can accommodate in the classroom. The available seats are assumed as r and n number of people are looking to accommodate within the room.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
long long permutations(int n, int r) {
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        result *= (r - i);
    }
    return result;
}
int main() {
    int n, r;
    cin >> n >> r;
    if (n > r) {
        cout << "Cannot adjust n people on r seats" << endl;
    } else {
            cout << permutations(n, r) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
